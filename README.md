# LINQ PROBLEMS
LINQ - Restriction Operators

## Use ListGenerators.cs & Customers.xml
1. Find all products that are out of stock.
2. Find all products that are in stock and cost more than 3.00 per unit.
3. Returns digits whose name is shorter than their value.
string[] Arr = { "zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine" };

## LINQ - Element Operators

Use ListGenerators.cs & Customers.xml
1. Get first Product out of Stock 
2. Return the first product whose Price > 1000, unless there is no match, in which case null is returned.
3. Retrieve the second number greater than 5 
int[] Arr = { 5, 4, 1, 3, 9, 8, 6, 7, 2, 0 };.

## LINQ - Set Operators

Use ListGenerators.cs & Customers.xml
1. Find the unique Category names from Product List
2. Produce a Sequence containing the unique first letter from both product and customer names.
3. Create one sequence that contains the common first letter from both product and customer names.
4. Create one sequence that contains the first letters of product names that are not also first letters of customer names.
5. Create one sequence that contains the last Three Characters in each names of all customers and products, including any duplicates
## LINQ - Aggregate Operators
###
 1. Uses Count to get the number of odd numbers in the array
int[] Arr = { 5, 4, 1, 3, 9, 8, 6, 7, 2, 0 };

### Use ListGenerators.cs & Customers.xml
2. Return a list of customers and how many orders each has.
3. Return a list of categories and how many products each has
4. Get the total of the numbers in an array.
int[] Arr = { 5, 4, 1, 3, 9, 8, 6, 7, 2, 0 };

### Use ListGenerators.cs & Customers.xml
6. Get the total units in stock for each product category.

### Use ListGenerators.cs & Customers.xml
8. Get the cheapest price among each category's products
9. Get the products with the cheapest price in each category (Use Let)

### Use ListGenerators.cs & Customers.xml
11. Get the most expensive price among each category's products.
12. Get the products with the most expensive price in each category.
14. Get the average price of each category's products.
